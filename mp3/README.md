# Voice sets for Nokolino

Here you find two voice sets: **Nokolino** for the **male** and **Nokolina** for the **female** version.

Plug in your JQ8400-module or Nokolino, delete the old files and copy the new mp3s on the module. Strictly observe the sequence!
021.mp3 must be copied as the 21st file. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Nokolino/wiki/Sprachset) for more 
detailed instructions.  

**Linux** and **Mac** can copy the files by simply marking them all and draging them into the folder. **Windows** has it's 
issues with the copying sequence. You can either copy them one by one oder use a copy tool like
[SmartCopyTool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smartcopytool).
